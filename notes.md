All windows are stored in the scratch pad. 

I can press a key to open a menu to see my current workspaces. When I select a workspace, all the windows are moved from the scratch pad to that workspace

Only chrome windows and tmux sessions are changed. 


bench.json
```
{
name: "work",
tabs: [x.com, y.com, z.com],
tmuxDir: "~/dev/bench"
}
```

Chrome defaults to workspace 1

Tmux defaults to workspace 3

Nothing else is changed

Menu lets you switch between workspaces
